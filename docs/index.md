# ES-Progress Bash Library

Hi! :cowboy_hat_face:

Here you can find the documentation for [_ES-Progress Bash Library_](https://github.com/es-progress/shell){target=\_blank}.

There are some standalone shell scripts, called "binaries" (`bin/`) here :wink: and various shell functions (`lib/`).
Certain functions are useful for interactive use on the command-line, while others makes more sense sourced in scripts.
It was written with Bash in mind therefore portability was not a requirement.

First, check the [Installation instructions](install.md).
Though most of the "binaries" are intended for standalone use which you can simply download and run,
some of them use functions from the library ("lib") and bootstrapping may not be trivial.

Then you can find the reference documentation for each script, function.
