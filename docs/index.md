# Introduction

Welcome! :cowboy_hat_face:

Here you can find the documentation for [_ES-Progress Bash Library_](https://github.com/es-progress/shell){target=\_blank}.
It aims to provide comprehensive guidance on using this library.

The library consists of standalone shell scripts, referred to here as "binaries" (`bin/`) :wink: and various shell functions (`lib/`).
Certain functions are designed for interactive use on the command line, while others are better suited for sourcing in scripts.
It was written with Bash in mind therefore portability was not a requirement.

First, check the [Installation instructions](install.md).
Though most of the "binaries" are intended for standalone use and can be simply downloaded and run,
some of them use functions from the function library (`lib/`), so bootstrapping may not be trivial and require additional setup.

Then you can find the reference documentation for each script and function.
