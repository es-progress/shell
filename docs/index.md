# Introduction

Welcome! :cowboy_hat_face:

Here you can find the documentation for [_ES-Progress Bash Library_](https://github.com/es-progress/shell){target=\_blank}.
It aims to provide comprehensive guidance on using this library.

The library consists of standalone shell scripts, referred to as "binaries" (`bin/`) here :wink: and various shell functions (`lib/`).
Certain functions are designed for interactive use on the command-line, while others make more sense sourced in scripts.
It was written with Bash in mind therefore portability was not a requirement.

First, check the [Installation instructions](install.md).
Though most of the "binaries" are intended for standalone use which you can simply download and run,
some of them use functions from the function library (`lib/`) and bootstrapping may not be trivial and require additional setup.

Then you can find the reference documentation for each script and function.
